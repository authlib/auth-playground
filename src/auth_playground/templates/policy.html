            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Auth Playground is a <strong>demonstration tool</strong> for OpenID Connect authentication.
                As this is a self-hosted application, you control all aspects of data handling.

            <h3>What Data Is Handled</h3>
            <p>
                When you authenticate through Auth Playground, the following information is received from your
                identity provider:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access token:</strong> Used to access protected resources</li>
                <li><strong>Refresh token:</strong> Used to obtain new access tokens (if provided)</li>
                <li><strong>ID token:</strong> Contains your identity information in JWT format</li>
                <li><strong>User information:</strong> Profile data such as name, email, phone, address, groups, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The exact data received depends on the scopes requested and what your identity provider shares.
            </p>

            <h3>How Data Is Stored</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>All authentication data is stored server-side in memory.</mark>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is stored in <strong>server memory</strong> (RAM) only</li>
                <li>A secure session cookie is sent to your browser (containing only a session ID, not the actual data)</li>
                <li>No database, files, or permanent storage is used</li>
                <li>All session data is lost when the application restarts</li>
                <li>Data is cleared when you log out</li>
                <li>Sessions expire according to Flask's default session timeout</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>
                Auth Playground does not:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Share your data with third parties</li>
                <li>Send data to external services</li>
                <li>Store data permanently</li>
                <li>Track your usage</li>
                <li>Use analytics or advertising</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The only external communication is with your configured identity provider for authentication purposes.
            </p>
